## 🔧 First-Time Setup

When you first launch ClaudeUsageBar, you'll see a welcome message. Follow these steps:

### Getting Your Session Cookie

1. Go to **Settings > Usage** on claude.ai
2. Press **F12** (or Cmd+Option+I on Mac)
3. Go to **Network** tab in DevTools
4. Refresh the page, click the "usage" request
5. Find **'Cookie'** in Request Headers
6. Copy the **full cookie value** (starts with `anthropic-device-id=...`)

### Adding Cookie to App

1. Click **"Set Session Cookie"** in the app
2. Paste your cookie (Cmd+V works!)
3. Click **"Save Cookie & Fetch"**
4. Your usage will appear immediately! 🎉

## ⚙️ Settings

Access settings by clicking the gear icon in the popup:

### Notifications
- Enable/disable usage alerts
- Get notifications at 25%, 50%, 75%, 90% thresholds
- Click "Test Notification" to verify it works

### Keyboard Shortcut (Cmd+U)
- Toggle popup from anywhere on your Mac
- Requires Accessibility permission
- Click "Enable Keyboard Shortcut" to grant permission

### Launch at Login
- Start ClaudeUsageBar automatically when you log in

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- ✅ **Session cookie stored in macOS Keychain** - encrypted at rest, protected by your login password
- ✅ **All data stays on your Mac** - no external services beyond claude.ai
- ✅ **No analytics or tracking** - zero third-party data collection
- ✅ **No hardcoded credentials** - org ID extracted dynamically from your cookie
- ✅ **Open source** - review the code yourself
- ✅ **Automatic migration** - existing cookies in UserDefaults are migrated to Keychain on first launch

## 🎯 How It Works

1. Uses your session cookie to authenticate with claude.ai API
2. Fetches usage data from the same endpoints the website uses
3. Extracts org ID dynamically from your cookie
4. Displays real-time usage in your menu bar
5. Sends notifications when you hit usage thresholds

## 🔨 Building & Distribution

### Build the App
```bash
./build.sh
```

### Create DMG Installer
```bash
./create_dmg.sh
```

### Clean Build
```bash
rm -rf build
./build.sh
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No data yet" showing
- Make sure you've pasted your session cookie
- Click "Save Cookie & Fetch"
- Verify you copied the full cookie string

### Cookie expired
- Session cookies expire periodically
- Get a new cookie from claude.ai
- Click "Clear Cookie" then re-add it

### Notifications not working
- Click "Test Notification" in Settings
- Notifications work without permission prompts
- Check macOS Focus mode isn't blocking them

### Cmd+U shortcut not working
- Click "Enable Keyboard Shortcut" in Settings
- Grant Accessibility permission in System Settings
- Restart the app after granting permission

### Usage not updating
- App auto-refreshes every 5 minutes
- Click the refresh button to update manually
